            <div class="box" id="description" style="display:none;">* just an example*  Snickers Pie (from food network)
                Ingredients:
                Six 1.56-ounce SnickersÂ® candy bars, roughly chopped (about 2 cups), plus more for garnish
                6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
                One 9-ounce package chocolate wafer cookies
                1/2 cup dulce de leche
                1/2 cup hot fudge sauce, warmed
                1 cup crunchy peanut butter
                One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature
                1 cup confectioners' sugar
                1 cup heavy cream
                1/2 cup salted roasted peanuts, chopped
                Directions:
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
                For the crust: Melt 1 cup of the candy bars with the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking frequently, about 4 minutes.
                Pulse the cookies in a food processor to fine crumbs. Drizzle in the candy mixture until the crumbs are completely coated. Firmly press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Bake until the crust is set, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread the dulce de leche over the warm crust with an offset spatula then drizzle with 1/4 cup hot fudge; set aside.
                For the filling: Beat the peanut butter, cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Whip the cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until combined. Fold in the remaining 1 cup chopped candy bars. Pour the filling into the crust, evening out the top with a spatula. Drizzle with the remaining 1/4 cup hot fudge sauce.
                Make a decorative ring around the edge of the pie (do not cover the crust) with more chopped candy bars, overlapping them slightly. Inside that ring, make a second ring with the chopped peanuts. Chill until set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.
