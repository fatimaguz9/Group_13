                <h1>Snickers Pie (from food network)</h1>
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li> Six 1.56-ounce Snickers® candy bars, roughly chopped (about 2 cups), plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
                <li>One 9-ounce package chocolate wafer cookies</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup dulce de leche</li>
                <li>1/2 cup hot fudge sauce, warmed</li>
                <li>1 cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
                <li>One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup salted roasted peanuts, chopped</li>
            </ul>
                <h2>Directions:</h2>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
                For the crust: Melt 1 cup of the candy bars with the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking frequently, about 4 minutes.
                Pulse the cookies in a food processor to fine crumbs. Drizzle in the candy mixture until the crumbs are completely coated. Firmly press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Bake until the crust is set, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread the dulce de leche over the warm crust with an offset spatula then drizzle with 1/4 cup hot fudge; set aside.
                For the filling: Beat the peanut butter, cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Whip the cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until combined. Fold in the remaining 1 cup chopped candy bars. Pour the filling into the crust, evening out the top with a spatula. Drizzle with the remaining 1/4 cup hot fudge sauce.
                Make a decorative ring around the edge of the pie (do not cover the crust) with more chopped candy bars, overlapping them slightly. Inside that ring, make a second ring with the chopped peanuts. Chill until set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.

                    <h2>Crust - </h2>
                    <li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus more for the work surface</li>
                    <li>4 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sale</li>

                    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water</li>
                    <h2>Filling - </h2>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>3 pounds baking apples, such as Golden Delicious, Cortland or Mutsu</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li> 
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li> 
                    <li>Generous pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                    <h2>Streusel Topping - </h2>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
                </ul>
                    <h2>Directions:</h2>
                    <li>For the dough: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter, and pulse until the mixture resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of butter. Add the egg, and pulse until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is very dry, add up to 1 tablespoon cold water.) Remove the dough, gently pat it into a round, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.</li>
                    <li>For the filling: Meanwhile, put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel and core the apples; cut each in half, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the apples and granulated sugar to the bowl with the lemon juice, and toss.</li> 
                    <li>For the filling: Meanwhile, put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel and core the apples; cut each in half, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the apples and granulated sugar to the bowl with the lemon juice, and toss.</li>
                    <li>Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to extract as much liquid as possible. Return the juice to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until it has thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.

                    </li>
                    <li>Toss the apples with the thickened juice, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Set aside to cool completely. (The cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months.)/li>
                    <li>For the streusel topping: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the butter, and rub it into the flour mixture with your fingers until it has been absorbed. Mix in the walnuts.</li>
                    <li>To assemble and bake the pie: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven, place a baking sheet on it and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough disk into a 12-inch circle. Layer it between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Ease the dough round into a 9-inch pie pan. Fold and crimp the edges as desired. Add the filling, and spread it out to make an even layer. Squeeze handfuls of the streusel topping, and drop clumps of it on top of the filling to completely cover it.</li>
                    <li>Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust and streusel are golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Let it cool on a cooling rack for at least 3 hours before serving. (The pie keeps well, covered, at room temperature for 24 hours or refrigerated for up to 4 days.)</li>
